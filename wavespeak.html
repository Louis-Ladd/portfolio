		<h1>Descriptions</h1>
		<h2>This project taught me how to use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview"
			target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fusion 360</a>, <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank"
			rel="noopener">KiCad</a> and the <a href="https://v2.tauri.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tauri</a>
			framework. This project was a huge undertaking for me because I had to design a PCB, case, select hardware and
			figure out how to get a raspberry pi running my software without much effort since writing a GUI operating
			system from scratch was not in the cards. It was a test of my time management and techincal skills.</h2>

		<h2>The Beginnings</h2>
				<p>The problem, talker tablets are either properitery, inconvenient or too expensive. This is the problem I wanted to solve, I went out to build a open, cheap, and flexible device that can cater to anyones needs while being easy to build with off the shelf electronics.
				<br />So I knew I wanted to get an idea of the case together before I started choosing hardware. I wanted an elgato stream deck style tablet so an array of buttons with a "bar" at the top is what I had in my head opening Fusion 360 to start the sketch.</p>
				<img src="./img/wsimg/rev0drawing.png">
				<p>As you can see, this was quite... optimistic for a design. There's barely space for any sort of electronics or wiring around the preimeter of the case. I had to change this when I finally found a display that I could use for the tablet.</p>
				<img src="./img/wsimg/rev1casedrawing.png">
				<p>So I Designed some more wiggle room on the sides but even this wasn't enough as the PCB for the display I chose took up more space vertically.</p>
