        <h2>This was a project for AP Computer Science A. For my final project, I wrote a simulation of the <a

            Reaction</a>.
          It was written in Java using AWT and Swing.</h2>

        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <h2>This project taught me how fun modeling chemical oscillations and reactions are. It was a fun deep dive into
          both programming and theoretical concepts, blending chemistry and computer science.</h2>

        <p>
          I used this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24989205" target="_blank">white paper</a> to get the
          equations to calculate the state of the cells.
          The cells' state is set according to the following rules:
          The cells' state is &gt; 1 and &lt; N where N is any integer. <br />
          The new state is dependant on A, B, and S which are defined as
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>A</span> = The number of ill cells <br />
          <span>B</span> = The number of ill cells in it's neighborhood <br />
          <span>S</span> = The sum of neighboring cells' states plus the current cells' state <br />

          If the cell is healthy (its state is 0), its new state is calculated as <br />

          <span>[A/k1] + [B/k2]</span> <br />

          Where <span>k1</span> and <span>k2</span> are constants <br />

          If the cell infected (its state is inbetween) <br />

          Its new state will be calculated as <br />

          <span>[S/A]+g</span><br />

          If the cell is sick (its state is &equals; N)

          <br /> <br />
          Here are some of my favorite outputs of this project.
