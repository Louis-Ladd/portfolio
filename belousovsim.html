        <h2>This was a project for AP Computer Science A. For my final project, I wrote a simulation of the <a

        <h1>What I learned</h1>
        <h2>This project taught me how fun modeling chemical oscillations and reactions are. It was a fun deep dive into
          both programming and theoretical concepts, blending chemistry and computer science.</h2>

        <p>
          I used this white paper to get the equations to calculate the state of the cells.
          <br>
          The cells follow these rules
          <br>

          If the cell is healthy (c = 0)

          The new state is dependant on A and B which are defined as <aside>
            A = The number of ill cells <br>
            B = The number of ill cells in it's neighborhood
          </aside>

          Here are some of my favorite outputs of this project.
